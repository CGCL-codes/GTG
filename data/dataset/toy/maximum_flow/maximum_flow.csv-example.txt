Let's solve it step by step. We can use the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. The paths with the corresponding capacity are as follows:
Found augmenting path: [<2>, <1>, <0>, <3>] with minimum residual capacity of 1. Updated the flow along this path. Total flow: 0+1=1;
Thus, the maximum flow from node <2> to node <3> is
