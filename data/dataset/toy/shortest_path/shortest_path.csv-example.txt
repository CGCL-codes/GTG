The visited nodes are: {node <2>: 0, node <4>: 7, node <0>: 9, node <5>: 9, node <1>: 12, node <3>: 12}

Round 4:
The unvisited nodes are: {node <0>: inf, node <1>: inf, node <4>: 13}
The visited nodes are: {node <3>: 0, node <5>: 3, node <6>: 8, node <2>: 9}
Round 5:
The unvisited nodes are: {node <0>: 16, node <1>: 17}
The visited nodes are: {node <3>: 0, node <5>: 3, node <6>: 8, node <2>: 9, node <4>: 13}
Round 6:
The unvisited nodes are: {node <1>: 17}
The visited nodes are: {node <3>: 0, node <5>: 3, node <6>: 8, node <2>: 9, node <4>: 13, node <0>: 16}
Finally, the distances to the visited nodes are {node <3>: 0, node <5>: 3, node <6>: 8, node <2>: 9, node <4>: 13, node <0>: 16, node <1>: 17}.
So the shortest distance from node <3> to node <5> is

Round 0:

The unvisited nodes are: {node <2>: inf, node <3>: inf, node <4>: inf, node <5>: 9}
The visited nodes are: {node <0>: 0, node <1>: 2}
Round 3:

The unvisited nodes are: {node <2>: 27}
The visited nodes are: {node <0>: 0, node <1>: 2, node <5>: 9, node <4>: 19, node <3>: 20}
Finally, the distances to the visited nodes are {node <0>: 0, node <1>: 2, node <5>: 9, node <4>: 19, node <3>: 20, node <2>: 27}.
So the shortest distance from node <0> to node <3> is
