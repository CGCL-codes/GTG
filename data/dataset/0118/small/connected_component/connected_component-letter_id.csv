Search from node MSB.
Visit neighbor node VPQ.
Search from node VPQ.
Visit neighbor node NDN.
Search from node NDN.
Visit neighbor node ODM.
Search from node ODM.
Visit neighbor node ECE.
Search from node ECE.
Visit neighbor node ESM.
Search from node ESM.
Visit neighbor node FMM.
Search from node FMM.
Visit neighbor node YFA.
Search from node YFA.
Visit neighbor node WVA.
Search from node WVA.
Visit neighbor node SZL.
Search from node SZL.
Visit neighbor node WSR.
Search from node WSR.
Node WSR is a root node, find a new strongly connected component: [WSR].
Visit neighbor node DXP.
Search from node DXP.
Visit neighbor node AJJ.
Search from node AJJ.
Node MSB is a root node, find a new strongly connected component: [AJJ, DXP, SZL, WVA, YFA, FMM, ESM, ECE, ODM, NDN, VPQ, MSB].
So the strongly connected component containing node MSB is ",0.8571428571428571,299
