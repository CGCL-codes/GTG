>> question:

Calculate the number of common neighbors of node <0> and node <4>. 

>> answer:

3

>> steps:

Let's calulate the number of common neighbors step by step.
Fisrtly, the neighbors of node <0> are [<11>, <1>, <2>, <10>, <3>, <4>].
Secondly, the neighbors of node <4> are [<5>, <1>, <8>, <6>, <10>, <3>, <0>].
Common neighbors of node <0> and node <4>: [<1>, <10>, <3>], which contains 3 nodes.
So the number of common neighbors is
