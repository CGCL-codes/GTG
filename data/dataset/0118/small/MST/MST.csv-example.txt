These edges make up its minimum spanning tree.
So the total weight of the minimum spanning tree is 

>> choices:

('[46, 52, 54, 0]',)

>> label:

0

>> answer_tree:

[(<0>, <9>, weight:2), (<9>, <8>, weight:1), (<9>, <1>, weight:1), (<1>, <11>, weight:1), (<1>, <5>, weight:2), (<11>, <3>, weight:3), (<3>, <6>, weight:3), (<6>, <13>, weight:1), (<13>, <2>, weight:2), (<6>, <7>, weight:5), (<7>, <4>, weight:5), (<5>, <14>, weight:6), (<7>, <10>, weight:7), (<3>, <12>, weight:7)]
