Let's calculate the Jaccard coefficient step by step.
The neighbors of node <6>: [<9>, <7>, <10>, <11>, <1>, <12>].
The neighbors of node <8>: [<3>, <13>, <10>, <4>].
The common neighbor set of node <6> and node <8> is: [<10>], and there are 1 elements.
The union neighbor set of node <6> and node <8> is: [<1>, <3>, <4>, <7>, <9>, <10>, <11>, <12>, <13>], and there are 9 elements.
So the Jaccard coefficient is the value of dividing the number of common neighbors by the number of union neighbors, i.e. 1 / 9 =

Let's calculate the Jaccard coefficient step by step.
