>> question:

Does the graph have a cycle? For a directed graph, a cycle is a closed path that traverses through a sequence of nodes and directed edges, eventually returning to the starting node. 

>> answer:

No

>> steps:

Let's solve it step by step. We can use the topological sorting algorithm to detect a cycle in the graph.
Nodes with 0 in-degree: [<3>, <6>].
Visit node <3> and remove it from the graph.
Nodes with 0 in-degree: [<6>].
Visit node <6> and remove it from the graph.
Nodes with 0 in-degree: [<7>, <5>].
Visit node <7> and remove it from the graph.
Nodes with 0 in-degree: [<5>].
Visit node <5> and remove it from the graph.
Nodes with 0 in-degree: [<0>].
Visit node <0> and remove it from the graph.
Nodes with 0 in-degree: [<9>].
Visit node <9> and remove it from the graph.
Nodes with 0 in-degree: [<1>, <11>, <8>].
Visit node <1> and remove it from the graph.
Nodes with 0 in-degree: [<11>, <8>].
Visit node <11> and remove it from the graph.
Nodes with 0 in-degree: [<8>, <10>].
Visit node <8> and remove it from the graph.
Nodes with 0 in-degree: [<10>, <2>].
Visit node <10> and remove it from the graph.
Nodes with 0 in-degree: [<2>, <4>].
Visit node <2> and remove it from the graph.
Nodes with 0 in-degree: [<4>].
Visit node <4> and remove it from the graph.
The result of topological sorting: [<3>, <6>, <7>, <5>, <0>, <9>, <1>, <11>, <8>, <10>, <2>, <4>] contains all the nodes in the graph, so the answer is
