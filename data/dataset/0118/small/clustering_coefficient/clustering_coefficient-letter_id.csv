There are 26 edges between them: [(NXC, NVH), (NXC, EPA), (NXC, JDI), (NXC, BWH), (NXC, GRZ), (NXC, GLB), (NXC, LEB), (NVH, JDI), (NVH, BWH), (NVH, MLC), (NVH, GLB), (NVH, LEB), (EPA, JDI), (EPA, BWH), (EPA, GRZ), (EPA, MLC), (EPA, GLB), (HCK, MLC), (HCK, LEB), (JDI, GRZ), (JDI, MLC), (BWH, GRZ), (BWH, GLB), (GRZ, GLB), (MLC, GLB), (MLC, LEB)].
Node BLG's degree is 10.
