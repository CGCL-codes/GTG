What is the clustering coefficient of node <9>?

0.0000

>> steps:

Let's calculate the clustering coefficient step by step.
For an undirected graph, the clustering coefficient for a node u is 2 * T / (D * (D - 1)), where T is the number of edges between neighbors of u, and D is the degree of u.
Node <9>'s neighbors are [<3>, <7>]. There are 0 edges between them: [].
Node <9>'s degree is 2.
So the the clustering coefficient of node <9> is 2 * 0 / (2 * (2 - 1)) =

Let's calculate the clustering coefficient step by step.
For an undirected graph, the clustering coefficient for a node u is 2 * T / (D * (D - 1)), where T is the number of edges between neighbors of u, and D is the degree of u.
Node <6>'s neighbors are [<3>, <1>, <7>, <5>]. There are 1 edges between them: [(<3>, <7>)].
